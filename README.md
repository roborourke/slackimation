Slackimation
============

Animated slack messages... Need I say more.

## Usage

Add the app to your slack team or if it's already there then just sign in!

If you're running it yourself as your own app then you'll need a `.env` file
like this one with the values filled in:

```
# Environment Config

SESSION_SECRET=

SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=
SLACK_CLIENT=
SLACK_SECRET=

DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_PASS=
DB_USER=

# note: .env is a shell file so there can't be spaces around '=
```
